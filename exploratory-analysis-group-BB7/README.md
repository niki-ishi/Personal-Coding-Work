# Exploratory Analysis

The purpose of this assignment is to provide you with the opportunity to explore your final project data and become familiar with collaborative coding techniques. By completing the assignment, you will demonstrate the following skills:

- Performing an exploratory analysis of a dataset
- Using R Markdown to create a report on the web
- Code and collaborate with others

Make sure you choose one person to accept this assignment and then add your teammates as collaborators.

## Assignment structure

For this assignment, your team will create an RMarkdown report about the datasets you have selected for your final project.

1. Your audience. The report will introduce your domain and data for your audience and allow you to set the foundations for your final project. Your audience might be, for example, a future employer, or someone who is knowledgeable in your project domain and would like to learn from you. 

2. Report elements. Your report must include all of the elements from your final project proposal. In other words, you should iterate on your project proposal, improving it, and writing it for your audience.

3. Additional elements. In addition your report must include: 

  - A paragraph of summary information, citing at least 5 values calculated from the data  
  - A table of  aggregated data (e.g., that has been "grouped" by one of your features)  
  - 3 charts that display information from the data (what you visualize is up to you)  

4. File organization. You will keep your code organized in multiple different files. This will help keep your project more modular and clear. You will create six different files for this project:

  - An index.Rmd file that renders your report **(Sabrina)**  
  - An .R file that calculates summary information to be included in your report  **(Lily)**
  - An .R file that creates a table of summary information to be included in your report **(Niki)**  
  - An .R file that creates your first chart **(Sabrina)**
  - An .R file that creates your second chart **(Vy)**
  - An .R file that creates your third chart **(Vy)**
